    User Package Manager install notes
    ==================================

Three group schemes are implemented:
group-equals-category: Every package user has a category as primary group
                       and "install" as supplementary group.
group-equals-install: Every package user has "install" as primary group and
                      categories as supplementary groups.
group-equals-packagename: Every package user has its name as primary group
                       and "install" as supplementary group.
In all cases, multiple supplementary groups can work as multiple categories
and install directories are owned by package:install. That way each package
can be the administrator of its own directories.

To install the package, type
  make VAR1=value VAR2=value ... install
The following variables are interpreted:
PREFIX: Directory where to find bin/, lib/ and share/ directories. [/usr]
HOMEDIR: User Packages home directories location. [/var/pkg]
LIBEXECDIR: Location for special binaries (set UID and GID).
            [/usr/libexec/upm]
GROUPSCHEME: One of the group schemes explained above (category, install or
             packagename). [install]
INSTALLDIRSADMIN: If you prefer a certain user to be the administrator (i.e.
                  owner) for all install directories, set this variable as the
                  corresponding username. If empty, each package user retains
                  the ownership of all the directories installed by it. []
Once the package is installed, these variables can be modified editing the
/etc/upm/upm.conf file.
